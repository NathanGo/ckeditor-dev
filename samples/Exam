Tasks
All of the tasks are manipulations over this given data structure:
var x = {

"name":"a",
"set":["set1","set2"],
"permission":"all"
},
"b":{
"name":"b",
"set":["set2"],
"permission":"all"
},
"c":{
"name":"c",
"set":["set2","set3"],
"permission":"owner"
}
};
You can choose to use lodash library in the solution, it is not must.
1.	Filter – Write a function that will filter x by permission, example:
filterX(x, 'owner')  will return the object:  
{
   "c":{
       "name":"c",
       "set":["set2","set3"],
       "permission":"owner"
   }
};
2.	Map – Write a function that will map x values by set, example:
mapX(x)  will return the object:  
{
 "set1":[
     {"name":"a", "set":["set1","set2"], "permission":"all"}
 ],
 "set2":[
     {"name":"a", "set":["set1","set2"], "permission":"all"},
     {"name":"b","set":["set2"],"permission":"all"},
     {"name":"c","set":["set2","set3"],"permission":"owner"}
 ],
 "set3":[
     {"name":"c","set":["set2","set3"],"permission":"owner"}
]}
